# tic-tac-toe
In 2017, I implemented my first Tic-Tac-Toe game in Visual Studio using C#.


The executable file can be found at: tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe_new_version/bin/Debug/Tic_tac_toe_new_version.exe

Note: Since it was implemented in Visual Studio, the application will only work on Windows machines. If you have a Mac or Linux-based system, you will have to use a virtual machine to access it.
